## "Bot Saves the Princess"
### Description
In this problem, you will receive two types of input.
The first: an odd integer n, which represents the side length of a square grid (dimensions are n by n).
The second: you will receive n Strings, which are each n characters long, which collectively represents that grid.

*Input*:
The given will contain three types of characters:
- "m", which represents Super Mario of the popular gaming franchise Super Mario Bros. by Nintendo, and will always be in the center of the grid.
- "p", which represents Princess Peach (from the same gaming franchise), and which will always be in one of the four corners of the grid.
- "-", which simply represents a step.

*Important*: Mario can only move in one of four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

*Output*:
